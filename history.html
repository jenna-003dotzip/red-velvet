        <h1>Notable Moments in Red Velvet's Career</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Debut</h2>
            <h3>August 1, 2014</h3>
            <p>
                Red Velvet debuted with the song Happiness. Four of the members, Irene, Seulgi, Wendy, and Yeri
                were part of SM Rookies, a pre-debut training team who would post content showing off their talents, 
                before debut. They were SM's first girl group to debut in five years, after f(x), who debuted in 2009.

                show that typically airs weekly. Kpop acts perform on stage in these shows to promote their new music. Every 
                week, a song that's being promoted at the time wins an award based on metrics such as voting, streaming, sales, 
                etc.

            <p>
                On Christmas day, Wendy was in an accident at rehearsal for 2019 SBS Gayo Daejeon, a year end music festival. She fell around 2.5 meters 
                off a platform and onto the stage, resulting in her breaking her pelvis, wrist, and cheekbone. She spent the next year or so mostly on hiatus 
                as she recovered from her injuries.
